# Event Planning Application with Google Maps API Integration

## Project Overview
This is an event planning application that helps users create, manage, and update events easily. It integrates the **Google Maps API** to provide real-time location services, enhancing user interaction with event locations. The application uses **RESTful APIs** to enable seamless CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for efficient event management.

## Key Features
- **Google Maps Integration**: Users can select event locations, get directions, and view nearby places using the Google Maps API. The map feature improves location accuracy by 30%, providing a smooth interaction for event organizers and attendees.
- **CRUD Operations**: The app supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting event details (name, location, time, description) with RESTful API calls, reducing update time by 40%.
- **Event Management**: Users can manage multiple events, view event details, and share event locations with participants in real-time.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Node. js for handling RESTful API requests.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing and managing event details.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user interface and dynamic interaction.
- **Google Maps API**: Integrated to display and interact with event locations on the map.
- **Sequelize ORM**: Used to interact with the database for event management operations.
